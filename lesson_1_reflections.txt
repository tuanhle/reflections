Using the file compare narrows down the error search to only differences. 

Having a history allows you to compare pervious working code to newer not-working code. Through comparison, differences and thus errors are narrowed down for debugging.

Multiple-file commits are more relevant when these files are interdependent on one another. If they are independent, there is no need for multiple-file commits.

NOTE!

git diff output = original file w/ additions and subtractions in order
