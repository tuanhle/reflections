When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you might want to use another computer and keep your files accessible via a cloud OR if you want to collaborate with others and use a common repository you all can access online.

If Git automatically pulls changes from the remote repository from another contributor, it might break or mess up a local working version you have. 

Forks are copied repositories on GitHub only. Clones are copied repositories, both local and on GitHub (public). Branches are copied versions of code within a repository.

It is good to have a copy of the last known state of the remote locally because it will be easier to keep track of your own changes and other collaborators' changes. Also, it helps ensure that whatever is public is a working version. You can add and test new features privately before making it public.

Collaborating using Git or GitHub would be easier because changes can be tracked, people can work on features at the same time and from their own local computer, no matter where they are in the world. However, it requires that the collaborators know how to use Git/GitHub.

Changes should be done in a separate branch when testing a new feature or as an alternative version of the master.
